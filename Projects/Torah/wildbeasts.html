    Day 11, Month 11
</h2>
<h3>Wild Beasts Wildin'</h3>
<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p>
    As Israel, we know that obedience is the love language of our Father in Heaven. 
    The Most High tells us about the wonderful blessings associated with obedience and, like a good Father, the horrible consequences of disobedience. 
    I don't think it's a coincidence that the list of punishments is basically three times longer than the list of blessings, but I think I know why.
</p>
<p><i class="italics">"If you walk in hostility toward Me and refuse to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times, according to your sins. I will send wild animals against you to rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your numbers, until your roads lie desolate."</i>
</p>
<p><i>Leviticus 26:21-22</i></p>
<h4>Long suffering</h4>
<p>
    Our Father is patient, therefore, according to Leviticus, He spreads out His punishments over time 
    in an effort to get us to wake up. If thes message isn't recieved by the recipients of the plagues then He 
    increases the intensity 7 fold. This goes on until an invasion from a powerful nation occurs and an exile 
    happens. I get that this is specific to Israel, but Yah is not incapable of 
    sending a message to a peoples outside of His Kingdom because He is the Elohim of all flesh. 
</p>
<h4>Nineveh</h4>
<p>
    Jonah was sent to a foreign nation for the sake of the peoples who "don't know their right from their left", in an
    effort to get them to repent. They did. And the crazy thing is that Jonah knew that the Most High would forgive them 
    if they humbled themselves, hence he tried to escape to Tarshish. My point here is that, a powerful nation was able
    to recieve a warning from the Most High in a similar way to how we would recieve a correctional message from our Father.
</p>
<h4>Wildin' Beasts</h4>
<p>
    I layed all that light ground work to say that its possible that we here in South Africa are seeing something of a similar 
    fashion, in terms of warnings from the Most High, perhaps a hint to how displeasing this nation is in the eyes of our Father.
    Within the span of two weeks, two tigers had escaped and were aught roaming the suburbs/residential areas and in one instance
    attacking someone.
