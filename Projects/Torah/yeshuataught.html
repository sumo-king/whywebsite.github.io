            <h3>Yahusha Defeated Sin and Death through Torah</h3>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>
                Simple truth is that Yeshua taught the law. He embodied it when He was on earth in the flesh. The only human to have ever done that. 
                Thus, He gained the keys to eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven and we received the Ruach Ha Kodesh as part of Yahuah’s (Father) promise. 
                Praise Yah.
            </p>
            <h4>How did He do it?</h4>
            <p>
                Well, simply put, the way He overcame sin was by not sinning at all during His life. This is the same way we overcome sin through Father’s Spirit’s help. 
                We make a conscious decision to not do that evil practice anymore, even though it might take a little bit of time for some of us, but we stomp it under our feet, like our Master did. 
                Death was conquered through His resurrection, granted He already received the power to resurrect people from Father. 
                For Him it was unique in a sense that He didn’t deserve death at all, yet because of the curse upon mankind, He had to go through it, and it just so happened to be in the most unjust way possible. 
            </p>
            <h4>Why so unjustly though?</h4>
            <p>
                Well He explained it to the Pharisees Himself saying, “And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but man loved darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil”. 
                It seems to me that when Father clearly and openly shows favour to His children, the people with hard hearts develop envy that grows to the point of wanting to commit murder. Cain and Able are an example, and some of Joseph’s brothers too. 
                Therefore, because they loved the darkness more than the light, because of the desires in their hearts, they murdered a blameless man. 
            </p>
            <h4>Yahuah didn't stop it</h4>
            <p>
                Because He wanted to reveal His righteousness. Simple. I believe that even if Yeshua lived till a ripe old age and died, that He would’ve still resurrected because He simply didn’t deserve to die at all. 
                But things happened the way they did to reveal Father’s righteousness and for justice to also be served rightly. 
                This way everyone is accountable for their own actions and it is plainly shown that evil profits nothing and the flesh profits nothing. Seeking righteousness as we seek bread and wisely ruling over our flesh is the most 
                logical way to live our lives that were given to us by Yahuah Tsevaot (Yahuah of Hosts).
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>If you’re wise then you already know the conclusion, “seek first the kingdom and His righteousness”. It’s very simple but you will definitely face some resistance. 
                All you have to remember is His word, which is wonderful because since we have the Ruach Ha Kodesh, we have a constant Helper within us to help us make the right choices, i.e. keep the commandments. 
                Thus, worshipping the Father and maintaining a perpetual peace with our Father through His faithful Son Yeshua.</p>
